Until [singer] Joe McElderry and [comedian] Sarah Millican came along and put it on the map, nobody I met had ever heard of it \u2013 so, when I was younger, I'd always tell people I was from Newcastle. There's a big rivalry between Newcastle and Sunderland; South Shields is in the middle, so you have to pick a side. I chose Newcastle, for its shopping and its football team. I live in Manchester now, but come back to Newcastle as often as I can \u2013 it's my favourite place to gig in. People often look down their noses at it. They watch Geordie Shore and think Newcastle is just a party city. You do get a lot of stag and hen dos, but Geordie Shore isn't an accurate representation of the city \u2013 just of one tiny group of people. There's a lot more to Newcastle than that.
